# About me
I'm Oskar van Velden, 34 years old and I live in Dordrecht

# Skills
I have a degree in Information Technology (2005), my thesis topic was greating a PHP CMS for Flash websites. I created it in PHP 5 (which was, at the time, pretty new).

After that I worked for years as a Flash Developer, up until 2011-2012. Then I worked as a mobile app developer for one year and since 2013 I work as a Web developer again. Mostly backend (PHP) and more-and-more JavaScript again.
